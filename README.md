# SKINS SEARCH DISCORD BOT

It uses web-scrapping to get information about the skins prices and some APIs to convert currencies.

NOTE: idk if it keeps working, it was an old project. 
If you want to try it, you should generate an discord OAuth token and get an access key to use http://data.fixer.io API (currency convertor).
